* DONE project wise annotations
 project-current

project-current is an autoloaded compiled Lisp function in ‘project.el’.

(project-current &optional MAYBE-PROMPT DIR)

Return the project instance in DIR or ‘default-directory’.
When no project found in DIR, and MAYBE-PROMPT is non-nil, ask
the user for a different directory to look in.  If that directory
is not a part of a detectable project either, return a
‘transient’ project instance rooted in it.

* DONE when on project ipa file should not use absolute path
use this to tell project option is set
  (equal ipa-file-function 'ipa-get-project-file)

make ipa-get-buffer-file-name return path relative from root
make  ipa-go-to-annotation aware of this too
* DONE reloading buffer duplicates annotations
  fix: use before-revert-hook
* DONE ipa-show-all can be called anywhere
currently if buffer has no anotations it's not possible to call
fixed: add ipa-show-all
* TODO ipa-show should show only annotation of the current buffer
* TODO ipa file can be org file
  and the ipa-mode now is minor mode
* DONE ipa-delete function
delete above
delete bellow
* DONE minor mode
  make ipa-mode
  can't make it a global mode because some mode such as helm-mode is incompatible with

* DONE remove ipa-toggle and ipa-annotation-display
now that it's a minor mode, ipa-toggle is working all buffers
we need ipa-clear on current buffer
* TODO handle overlays when text changes
symbol-overlays uses
(add-hook 'after-change-functions 'symbol-overlay-refresh)

add ipa-refresh for manual action

* DONE multiline support on edit/insert comments  with evil :TIL:
make minibuffer to work as a normal buffer. This one can be useful as a lib

* TODO annotation on region, drop inline annotations
* TODO why the comments are not attached to any string in buffer
delete string, comment remains
comments must stick to string

you need to listen to change hooks
* DONE indent incorrect on edit above
[[file:ipa.el::(defun ipa-set-overlay-text-above (overlay text)][indent]] value is not on the desired line on ipa-edit above (previous)
because cursor is put on the line above

fix: in ipa-edit when use ipa-previous, run also forward-char 

this is not a very clean fix
