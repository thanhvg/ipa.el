* Intro
With this package you can add annotations to your files without modifying them.
Each file can have multiple annotations at various buffer positions. The
annotation texts are not parts of the files, they are stored separately.

All annotations are stored in a common file, so searching annotations is
trivial.

* Installation

#+begin_src elisp
(require 'ipa)
#+end_src

* Commands

| =ipa-insert=   | insert annotation at point                          |
|--------------+-----------------------------------------------------|
| =ipa-edit=     | edit the first annotation after point               |
|              | (with universal argument: before point)             |
|--------------+-----------------------------------------------------|
| =ipa-next=     | goes to the next annotation in the buffer           |
|--------------+-----------------------------------------------------|
| =ipa-previous= | goes to the previous annotation in the buffer       |
|--------------+-----------------------------------------------------|
| =ipa-move=     | move the first annotation after point               |
|              | (with universal argument: before point)             |
|--------------+-----------------------------------------------------|
| =ipa-toggle=   | hide/show annotations                               |
|--------------+-----------------------------------------------------|
| =ipa-show=     | show all saved annotations for the current file     |
|              | (in the storage buffer you can press Enter on any   |
|              | annotation to go to its location)                   |
|--------------+-----------------------------------------------------|
| =ipa-jump=     | jump to any annotation with id completion           |
|              |                                                     |
|              | Annotations can optionally have ids in their        |
|              | text with the following format: =[id]annotation-text= |
|              |                                                     |
|              | The id itself doesn't appear in the annotated       |
|              | buffer. It only serves the purpose of giving a      |
|              | unique id to the annotation, so that you can jump   |
|              | to it quickly.                                      |
|              |                                                     |
|              | If an annotation has an id, but no other text       |
|              | then it is effectively the same as a usual          |
|              | bookmark in emacs.                                  |
|              |                                                     |
|              | Only annotations appearing in =ipa-file= can be       |
|              | jumped to, so unsaved annotations does not count.   |
|              | If there are more annotations defined with the      |
|              | same id then the first one found in `ipa-file' is   |
|              | used.                                               |
